**Purpose and Context**

The purpose is to provide constructive feedback to a graduate student to help improve their academic writing skills and thesis quality.

**Task Definition**

The task is to write 1-2 paragraphs of feedback after reviewing 2-3 excerpt paragraphs from the student's thesis.

**Instructions**

**Content**

-Assess the overall clarity and readability of the text - are explanations and concepts sufficiently developed and easy to understand? Provide suggestions to improve clarity.
-Evaluate use of evidence - are claims supported by relevant examples and citations? Recommend adding more evidence where needed.
-Assess organization - is there a clear introduction, structure, and conclusion? Suggest improvements.
**Style**

-Consider academic tone and style - is language precise and suitable for a thesis? Note any informal wording.
-Check transitions between ideas - do paragraphs and concepts flow logically? Flag any abrupt topic changes.
**Grammar**

-Check for grammatical errors - focus on commonly missed items like subject-verb agreement, punctuation, capitalization. Note any patterns.
-Review sentence structure - identify any awkward phrasing or run-on sentences. Suggest variating length and structure.
-Check for wordiness - identify unnecessary phrases and repetitive ideas to condense.
**Additional Feedback**

-Identify patterns in grammar, sentence structure, word choice, etc. that occur multiple times in the thesis excerpts. Note these patterns directly in the feedback.
-Provide specific, constructive suggestions for improvement rather than only criticism. Use a professional and supportive tone.
-Recommend techniques and resources to help strengthen academic writing skills.
-Motivate the student with positive reinforcement on strengths and concrete advice on areas needing growth.
