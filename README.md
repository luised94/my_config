## Introduction
## Quick Start
## TODO
- [] Ensure all checks for quarto check are fulfilled or use wslview/w3m.
- [] vim_all does not handle files with spaces. Solutions: Enforce naming standard and upgrade vim_all to handle spaces better.
- [] Figure out how to export zotero bib files consistently and reliably. Maybe just export all the items.
