# Puerto Rican Sofrito Recipe

## Ingredients (per serving):

-   1/2 bunch of culantro (also known as recao)
-   1 bunch of cilantro
-   2 cochinella sweet peppers
-   4 garlic cloves
-   1 red bell pepper
-   1 green bell pepper
-   1 white onion
-   2 tablespoons of cooking oil
-   1 tablespoon of salt

## Instructions:

1.  Begin by washing all your vegetables thoroughly to remove any dirt or impurities. This step is crucial to ensure a clean and safe sofrito.

2.  Prepare your ingredients for blending: Chop the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, white onion, and garlic cloves into small pieces. Keep them separate for now.

3.  If you have a commercial blender, you can blend all the ingredients together in one go. However, if you're using a standard blender, you'll need to blend in batches.

4.  For standard blenders: Add a portion of the red bell pepper, garlic, onion, and a little cooking oil to the blender. Blend until smooth. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are blended.

5.  Once all the vegetables are blended into a smooth mixture, add the culantro (recao), cilantro, cochinella sweet peppers, and salt to the blender. Blend until everything is well combined.

6.  If needed, add a bit more cooking oil to achieve your desired consistency. The sofrito should have a thick, paste-like texture.

7.  Transfer the freshly made sofrito into a clean jar or airtight container. Seal it tightly.

8.  Store the sofrito in the refrigerator, where it can last for up to two weeks. Feel free to use it in various Puerto Rican dishes to enhance their flavor.
