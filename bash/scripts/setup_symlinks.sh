# Setup symlinks for dotfiles and neovim manually
# If there are already symlinks setup, you must remove them and backup the files you are currently using. 
ln -s ~/my_config/dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc
ln -s ~/my_config/nvim ~/.config/nvim/
# TODO setup an automation script once I have many more files to setup.
