## Introduction
Creating a neovim configuration from scratch. The main purpose is to learn about neovim, lua, plugins, etc. At the end, it should be a personal configuration. 
My main requirements are: Writing, R and bash programming, Zotero, Quarto, Markdown. 
I currently use the kickstart configuration as a stable config. Most of my setup will likely derive from this and other more popular distributions. 

## Installation 
Reference the neovim-config.md file to see how neovim was installed.

```{bash}
git clone -b feature/nvim-from-scratch https://github.com/luised94/my_config.git
```

## TODO
* Figure out how to specify how to git clone the specific nvim folder without cloning the my_config repository.
* Configure options.
* Configure autocomplete and snippets.
* Configure setup for R.
* Configure setup for bash.
* Configure setup for Zotero and citations.
* Configure setup for quarto.
