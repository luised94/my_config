title: Setting up shell configuration
---

This document contains general steps for configuring the bash shell. I use wsl on windows and have not explored other modern alternatives to bash.
I have mostly used bash 5.1.16 and bash 4.2.0 (while working on my institution's linux cluster).
Has not been tested thoroughly. No guarantees.
Other tools that I use are neovim, zotero (on windows), R and quarto.

I am considering starship, just, jq, procs, and hyperfine.
## General setup
I initially installed an outdated version of neovim distro (not compatible with plugins).
```{bash}
# If you installed neovim from command line,
# below I build it from source.
sudo apt remove -y neovim
sudo apt autoclean && sudo apt autoremove -y

# Core system tools
apt-get update and upgrade
sudo apt install -y build-essential make unzip git wslu
# Development dependencies
sudo apt install -y gcc clang llvm lld

# CLI productivity
sudo apt install -y ripgrep fzf bat tmux
sudo apt install -y shfmt shellcheck

# PDF utilities
sudo apt install -y qpdf poppler-utils

# Wsl <-> Windows integration
sudo apt install -y xclip xsel
```

## Setup symbolic links for bashrc
Remove all gz files that were downloaded when install quarto, nvim, R and pandoc.
```{bash}
# Remove any bashrc. Backup if necessary.
rm ~/.bashrc
sudo ln -s ~/my_config/dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc
# I have a second for bashrc for when I work in linux cluster. Perform same action.
```
