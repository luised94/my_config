Windows start at 0. Can create windows with another number. Not sure the limit.

Completed new_worktree function and sync_repos functions that take advantage of the centralization in the personal_repos/ directory. Now I need to figure out how to automate tmux session creation for all of the directories in the personal_repos/ directory. I think the best would be to have the default repos be main or master and use worktrees for branches

Got the script to setup tmux to work.
Will create the symbolic link from my repo to the home directory to use the basic settings (extend status bar so it displays entire name.)
Took the content of the tmux file (which I did not remember I had) and added to my dotfile, remove the file and created the link.

```bash
rm ~/.tmux.config
ln -s $(readlink -f dotfiles/tmux.config) $(readlink -f ~/.tmux.config)
```
