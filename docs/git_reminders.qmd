# Overview
Combinations of git commands that encapsulate common operations


## 2025-08-05 Deleting branch locally and remotely
Check if the branch has been completely merged and then delete if no longer needed
```bash
# Check if branch is fully merged
git branch --merged
# Combine with grep for a specific branch
git branch --merged | grep "mybranch"

# Compare commits
git log --oneline main..your-branch-name
# See diff between branches
git diff main your-branch-name
# Check if branch is ahead/behind main
git rev-list --left-right --count main...your-branch-name

# Delete the branches
git branch -d your-branch-name
git push origin --delete your-branch-name
#OR
git push origin :your-branch-name
# Clean up all branches that do not exist in remote
git fetch --prune
```
